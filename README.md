## 🧠 Overview

The **HEART Emotional Codex Companion** is the official emotional grammar reference system for all HEART-compliant and MEC-aligned applications.

This repository defines the emotional backbone of Functional Empathy in AI — including:

- Emotion Families (primary, secondary, and microstates)
- Symbolic Anchoring Logic (SAL)
- Cultural Expression Mappings (CEM/CVM)
- Emotion Blend Tables
- Emotional Arc Patterns and Triggers
- EmotionID trace structure for empathy-safe systems

---

## 🌍 Purpose

Functional Empathy is not about simulation. It’s about **interpreting**, **reasoning**, and **responding** to emotional states with safety, dignity, and cultural respect.

The Codex ensures AI systems:
- Recognize emotional diversity
- Anchor emotional processing in symbolic logic
- Avoid emotional hallucinations or overreach
- Align with HEART ethical boundaries
